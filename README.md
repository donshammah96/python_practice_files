## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python_practice_files.git
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Navigate to the folder containing the script you want to run:
    ```bash
    cd python_practice_files/<folder_name>
    ```
5. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```

For the `pytest` tests, simply run:
```bash
pytest
```
This will automatically discover and run all the test files.
